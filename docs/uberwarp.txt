/uw ae - Enter abyssea from a cavernous maw.  This cannot bypass traverser stone sickness.

/uw ad [Optional: Zone Name/Alias/CHECK] - Automatically detect which warp system is available, and trigger it using the specified command(if specified).
NOTE: It is possible to be in range of 2 systems, such as at northern sandoria HP#1 spaced between the survival guide and home point.
If you are in such a position, there is no guarantee /uw ad will trigger the system you want(/uw ad rabao could hit either the home point or the survival guide).
To ensure you get the results you are aiming for, either use the more specific command or ensure you are more than 5.5 yalms away from all but one warp method.
Castoff points will go downstream if possible in foret.  Dimensional portals will go to Reisenjima, not Al'taieu.

If you prefer not to have multiple argument commands, aliases are still a thing!  Add them to your startup script:
/alias /hp /uw hp
/alias /sg /uw sg
etc.

Safety/Convenience Features:
-Automatically coordinates a delay if multiple chars on same PC are using same NPC.  No need for special commands, multisend away.
-Will force the NPC to appear if server fails to draw it and you're in range of where it should be.
-Verifies you have the destination portal unlocked and enough currency to use it for all systems.
-Completes all menus accurately to retail client, for both same zone and other zone warps.

Typed commands:
-You may skip spaces and punctuation when typing zone names or aliases.  Spelling must be correct.
-Default aliases are zonename, zonename2, zonename3, etc.  Frontier stations are zonename, bivouacs are zonename#.  Adoulin waypoints are as listed in file.
-You may change the text used to trigger Home Points, Waypoints, or Survival Guides by going into the xml files in ashita/resources/entities/, and changing the 'alias' field.
-You may use multiple aliases for a single HP, WP, or SG by copying the line and adding a different alias for the copy.
-Do not modify anything else in these files.  They will self update with entity index or menu id changes, and can be trusted to maintain themselves.
-These files contain vital data for the plugin to function appropriately and create the proper results.  Be very careful not to make any accidental changes if modifying aliases.
-Changes made while plugin is loaded may be overwritten when the plugin updates the files.  Ensure nobody has the plugin loaded prior to modifying aliases to avoid this.

For some systems, you will have to unlock the system first for commands to work properly:
-Talk to Anastase in Ru'lude gardens to unlock proto-waypoints.
-Complete appropriate mission access to use escha entrances, abyssea entrances.
-Complete appropriate quests to use scalable areas, castoff points.
-Complete appropriate cutscenes to use abyssea warps.
-Kill appropriate wildskeeper reive to use crystal warps.

If you want to warp to points you do not have unlocked yet, you can bypass the safety checks.
-Create a new text file in ashita/config named uberwarp.txt.
-Type into it, exactly as listed: I acknowledge that using uberwarp for locations I have not yet unlocked may get me banned.
-Save the file, reload the plugin.
-The plugin will no longer check if you have a warp unlocked before sending the packets.
